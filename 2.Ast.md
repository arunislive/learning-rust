## 2. AST Transformation (Abstract Syntax Tree)
Rust represents expressions in a structured way using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

Example Rust code:
```rust
let sum = 5 + 3;
```

### AST Representation:
```plaintext
Expr::BinaryOperation {
    left: Expr::Literal(5),
    op: '+',
    right: Expr::Literal(3)
}
```

### Why is `5 + 3` a `BinaryOperation`?
- **Infix Operator**: Operates between two operands.
- **AST Nodes**: Decomposes expressions into hierarchical tree structures.
