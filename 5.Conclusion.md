## 5. Conclusion
Rustâ€™s compilation process ensures:
- **Safe memory management** via MIR borrow checking.
- **Optimized execution** via LLVM IR transformations.
- **Well-structured code analysis** through AST & HIR.

Understanding AST & transformations helps in debugging and writing efficient Rust programs.
